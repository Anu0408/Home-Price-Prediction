## **Project Overview**

This project is a **real-time, end-to-end machine learning application** that predicts property prices based on a set of features provided by the user. The pipeline includes all stages from data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and real-time web interface integration. It is built using Flask for the web app, machine learning models for prediction, and MLflow for experiment tracking and model management.

### **Key Components of the Project:**
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: From data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and prediction.
- **Flask Web Application**: Frontend interface where users can input property details and receive price predictions.
- **MLflow Integration**: Tracks experiments, models, and metrics for consistent version control and efficient model management.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Predicts house prices in real-time as users input property details.

## **Features**

1. **Real-Time House Price Prediction**:
   - Input property features (e.g., area, number of bedrooms, amenities) and get instant predictions.
   
2. **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline**:
   - Data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
   - Predictive models trained using advanced regression techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ElasticNet.

3. **MLflow Experiment Tracking**:
   - Logs experiment details including hyperparameters, metrics, and models.
   - Facilitates model versioning and comparison for tracking model performance over time.
   
4. **Web Interface**:
   - **Input Form**: Users can fill in property details such as area, price per square foot, number of bedrooms, and more.
   - **Dynamic Results**: Predictions are displayed on a separate results page.
   
5. **Model Retraining**:
   - The system allows retraining the model on-demand using the `/train` route.

## **Real-Time End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline**
- **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Includes normalization of numerical features and encoding categorical variables.
   - Cleans and prepares the data for model training.
- **Model Training:**
   - Models include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ElasticNet regression.
   - Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance.
- **Prediction Pipeline:**
   - Takes user input via the web interface and returns predicted property prices based on the trained model.
   - MLflow Integration
- **Experiment Tracking:**
   - Logs parameters, metrics (e.g., RÂ², MSE), and artifacts during model training.
   - Facilitates comparison between different models and configurations.
- **Model Versioning:**
   - Allows users to track and compare multiple versions of the model in the MLflow registry.
- **Model Deployment:**
   - MLflow makes it easy to transition from experimentation to production-ready models.
   - Frontend (Web Interface)
- **HTML Templates:**
   - index.html: Renders input form for property details.
   - results.html: Displays predictions based on user input.
- **Dynamic Routing:**
   - /predict: Handles POST requests, processes user input, and displays the prediction.
   - /train: Triggers the retraining of the model and logs new experiments.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/HousePricePrediction.git
- cd HomePricePrediction
- create a virtual environment
### 2. Install Dependencies**
- Install all required Python packages using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
### **3. Set Up MLflow**
- Start the MLflow tracking server (if using local server): mlflow ui
- Access the MLflow UI at http://localhost:5000.
- Configure a remote tracking server by setting the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variable: export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://your-remote-server"
- [Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)
- [dagshub](https://dagshub.com/)
### **4. Run the Application**
- Start the Flask application: python app.py
- Access the application at http://localhost:8080.

### Usage
- ### **1. Predict Property Price**
Open the web app in your browser.
Fill out the form with details such as:
   - Property area
    - Price per square foot
   - Number of bedrooms
   - Available amenities (e.g., pool, park, gym, etc.)
   - Submit the form to get the predicted house price instantly.
- ### **2. Retrain the Model**
To retrain the model:
Navigate to the /train route in your browser:
http://localhost:8080/train
This will trigger the training pipeline and update the model, with experiments tracked in MLflow.
- ### **3. Track Experiments with MLflow**
Access the MLflow UI at http://localhost:5000 to monitor training experiments.
View metrics, parameters, and models.
Compare experiments to evaluate model performance.



### Future Improvements
- Enhanced Model Accuracy: Incorporate more sophisticated machine learning models and fine-tune hyperparameters further.
- MLflow Automation: Use MLflow's deployment capabilities for seamless model deployment to production environments.
- Database Integration: Add support for persistent data storage using relational or NoSQL databases.
- Cloud Deployment: Host the application and MLflow on cloud services such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.
